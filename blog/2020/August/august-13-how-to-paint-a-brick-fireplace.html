Once your primer is completely dry we can move to the final step! I\n                                recommend using indoor heat resistant paint, semigloss or gloss rated to bear up against\n                                temperatures created by the fireplace (generally about 200 F) and a roller designed for\n                                textured surfaces. The roller helps cover the surface of the brick in a quicker time frame\n                                rather than using a simple paintbrush for all around approach. For any spots you can&#39;t\n                                reach using your roller touch up with a small paintbrush. Apply a second and third coat as\n                                needed allowing a good deal of drying time between coats.\n                            </P>\n                            <P>\n                                <STRONG>Congratulations!</STRONG> You made it through painting a brick fireplace! I hope your results were as\n                                envisioned in your thoughts! Keep in mind if they did not come out as desired we would be\n                                happy to come out and take a look!",

                                A latex primer protects your paint against future residue stains from fireplace use, and also
                                makes it easier to wipe clean in the future. Apply primer to the entire surface, following the
                                manufacturers directions. Let dry.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now for the fun part! Once your primer is completely dry we can move to the final step! I
                                recommend using indoor heat resistant paint, semigloss or gloss rated to bear up against
                                temperatures created by the fireplace (generally about 200 F) and a roller designed for
                                textured surfaces. The roller helps cover the surface of the brick in a quicker time frame
                                rather than using a simple paintbrush for all around approach. For any spots you can't
                                reach using your roller touch up with a small paintbrush. Apply a second and third coat as
                                needed allowing a good deal of drying time between coats.

                                <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You made it through painting a brick fireplace! I hope your results were as
                                envisioned in your thoughts! Keep in mind if they did not come out as desired we would be
                                happy to come out and take a look!
