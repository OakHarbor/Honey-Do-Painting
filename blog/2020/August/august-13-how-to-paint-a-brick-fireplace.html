                    set aside about four to five hours of your time but not to worry this can be finished in only

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Clean the surface</h4>
                            <p>
                                You will need to thoroughly clean the brick, this ensures any chip off spots due to a dirty
                                surface and also so your paint dries properly. Use a wire scrub brush to remove any dirt or
                                dust. Then apply your cleaning product of choice. Rinse and let dry. You can wipe dry with a
                                towel to speed up the drying process.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Prep Surroundings</h4>
                            <p>Cover your floor with a drop cloth and tape off any areas you want to remain paint free!
                            Taking time for this step is crucial to your final look! I recommend not taking any shortcuts,
                            this step is a tevious one so have patience!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Prime the brick</h4>
                            <p>
                                A latex primer protects your paint against future residue stains from fireplace use, and also
                                makes it easier to wipe clean in the future. Apply primer to the entire surface, following the
                                manufacturers directions. Let dry.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Paint the brick</h4>
                            <p>
                                Now for the fun part! Once your primer is completely dry we can move to the final step! I
                                recommend using indoor heat resistant paint, semigloss or gloss rated to bear up against
                                temperatures created by the fireplace (generally about 200 F) and a roller designed for
                                textured surfaces. The roller helps cover the surface of the brick in a quicker time frame
                                rather than using a simple paintbrush for all around approach. For any spots you can't
                                reach using your roller touch up with a small paintbrush. Apply a second and third coat as
                                needed allowing a good deal of drying time between coats.
                            </p>
