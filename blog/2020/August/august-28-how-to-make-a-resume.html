Here at Honey Do Painting we believe first impressions\n                    mean everything! Therefore if you are looking to be employed through us the first step is\n                    sending in your resume. Below is a list of important information to include.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Name, Address, Phone Number and Email</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        Yes we know this is stating the obvious, however sometimes people can get too ahead of\n                        themselves and not include a phone number. Or if just updating your resume make sure your\n                        address and phone number are up to date. It is great to have this information as a header in a big\n                        font, maybe even have the font blue, just to add a special touch!\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Job Objective</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        State and describe your objective as distinct as possible.

If however your job experience is more pertinent to the\n                        position or if your education is not recent, you will want to list job experience before Education. The\n                        most recent education should be stated first.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Work Experience</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        There are two ways you can state your work experience. One way is to start with the most relevant\n                        experience and go to the least relevant. The second way would be to state your most recent work\n                        experience to your least recent work experience. Also this would be the best place to include\n                        volunteer experience. If you are forgetful like myself a helpful hint I discovered is going on indeed\n                        and researching your old job title to brush you up on your job tasks.

Be as detailed as\n                        possible and don&#39;t forget to add up to three references.

                    be glad to give you some help! Here at Honey Do Painting we believe first impressions
                    mean everything! Therefore if you are looking to be employed through us the first step is

                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Name, Address, Phone Number and Email</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes we know this is stating the obvious, however sometimes people can get too ahead of
                        themselves and not include a phone number. Or if just updating your resume make sure your

                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Job Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        State and describe your objective as distinct as possible. Avoid run on sentences and over
                        explaining yourself.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Special Skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        Put this category directly after Job Objective if your professional experience does not reflect the
                        skills that best support this job.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your job objective and the amount of education you have had, you may want to

                        most recent education should be stated first.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways you can state your work experience. One way is to start with the most relevant
                        experience and go to the least relevant. The second way would be to state your most recent work
                        experience to your least recent work experience. Also this would be the best place to include

                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Red Flags to Avoid</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poor or complex formatting</li>
                        <li>No targeting</li>
                        <li>No measurable results</li>
                        <li>Unexplained gaps in employment</li>
                        <li>Resume over 3 pages long</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Using Action Words</h3>
                    <p>Be sure to use action words for a strategic resume, short clear phrases.
                    For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accomplished</li>
                        <li>Built</li>
                        <li>Coordinated</li>
                        <li>Developed</li>
                        <li>Established</li>
                        <li>Improved</li>
                        <li>Managed</li>
                        <li>These are all great words that add an awesome touch!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Just remember you are creating your marketing program to sell the brand : YOU.
