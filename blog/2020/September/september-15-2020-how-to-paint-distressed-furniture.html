If you sand off too much of the chalk paint you will start to see the color\n                        underneath the new paint, or the wood underneath. With that being said i like to use\n                        steel wool.

I always like to apply thin coats and\n                                add coats if necessary. This prevents having that caked on look or having drip spots\n                                shown in paint.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Four:</STRONG> Let it dry</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break!

Try and get the spots where your\n                                furniture would naturally show wear and tare. On dressers the corners are a great spot\n                                and for kitchen chairs the edges and tops of chairs are a good plalce. Keep in mind the\n                                raised details in furniture generally get more worn over time. After you pick the areas on\n                                furniture to distress take your steel wool and lightly rub the area till you see paint is\n                                being removed. Continue distressing until object looks as desired. Note, using clear\n                                \n                                finishing wax is only recommended not required. You can rub the steel wool dry and get\n                                that distressed look.The wax helps the distressed area look lighter.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Give yourself a pat on your back!!</STRONG> We hope your newly painted furniture adds that\n                            farmhouse style to your home! Distressing furniture is so much fun! Antique furniture\n                            can be pricey, therefore i love going to a goodwil shop picking out a piece of furniture\n                            and bringing it back to life!

                            <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Paint the furniture</p>
                            <p>
                                If you are like me, this step is one of my favories! I always like to apply thin coats and
                                add coats if necessary. This prevents having that caked on look or having drip spots
                                shown in paint.

                            <p>
                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break! Let furniture dry, do not rush this step!

                            <p><strong>Step Five:</strong> Distress furniture</p>
                            <p>
                                Lightly dip your steel wool into a clear finishing wax. Try and get the spots where your
                                furniture would naturally show wear and tare. On dressers the corners are a great spot
                                and for kitchen chairs the edges and tops of chairs are a good plalce. Keep in mind the
                                raised details in furniture generally get more worn over time. After you pick the areas on
                                furniture to distress take your steel wool and lightly rub the area till you see paint is
                                being removed. Continue distressing until object looks as desired. Note, using clear
                                
                                finishing wax is only recommended not required. You can rub the steel wool dry and get
                                that distressed look.The wax helps the distressed area look lighter.
