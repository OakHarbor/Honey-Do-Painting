      "articleBody" : "No plans for Labor Day weekend? Make the most of it and paint the kitchen! I believe\n                        the kitchen is the heart of the home. We spend countless hours cooking, cleaning, and\n                        in my family&#39;s case just hanging out. So why not make our kitchen beautiful?! We\n                        bought our home back in June of 2019 and thanks to our busy life we did not get\n                        around to painting it until March of 2020. However it is so much more enjoyable. I\n                        wished we had taken care of it months ago!! Here are some tips we would like to share\n                        about problems we encountered and things we would do differently for next time.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Prepping kitchen cabinets for paiting - absolutely no shortcuts.</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        Correct prepping is crucial to your final outcome! Many of us just want the final result\n                        that we skip through important parts. For example tapping off the walls, removing\n                        cabinets, unscrewing knobs, and sanding down rough areas. These are all parts that\n                        we recommend taking your time on!! Over time it&#39;s likely your kitchen has grease\n                        stains that have built up. Simply take a soft cloth, mix with water, liquid grease fight\n                        dish soap and wipe down the wall. You can use an old toothbrush for harder to reach\n                        areas. Fill in any holes/ dents/ scratches with caulking or wood filler, be sure to\n                        smooth it out then sand down.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Priming your kitchen cabinets</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        We recommend using high quality stain blocking primer. After you have sanded down\n                        the area to where it is smooth and assured there is no leftover dust on the hard to\n                        reach areas you&#39;re ready to add prime. A simple roller paint brush might be your best\n                        bet to get it done in an easier manner depending on your kitchen. Make sure and get\n                        the detailed areas on the cabinet doors and the walls behind your fridge! Let dry. One\n                        coat should do the job however apply as many coats as desired.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Paint your cabinets!</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        Here is the fun part!! Once your primer is COMPLETELY dry you can add your paint! I\n                        would recommend a darker color for your cabinets. One of my favorites is a royal blue\n                        or sage green they always turn out stunning! If you have children their fingerprints\n                        tend to show up alot faster on lighter colors, especially white! Also another defect in\n                        painting white for cabinets are they tend to go yellow over time in the kitchen.\n                        Cabinets and kitchen walls are a high use area and darker colors seem to last a lot\n                        longer.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Drying process</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        This step is so important! I can&#39;t repeat it enough! Even though you are excited about\n                        your outcome,hopefully, let them dry completely before reassembling the\n                        cabinets/drawers etc. I have seen way too many projects gone wrong because they did\n                        not wait long enough for the product to dry.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Add sealer/top coat to your cabinets</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        Sealer or topcoat is completely up to you, although this will help later down the line\n                        when you want to go clean or wipe down the area. We would recommend a clear\n                        polyurethane finish over the paint. Again apply as many coats as desired.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Cabinets, ASSEMBLE!</H3>\n                    <P>\n                        The very last step is reassembling your cabinets, drawers and knobs. You can find\n                        beautiful knobs online to add such a unique touch! We hope you absolutely love your\n                        new kitchen and recommend celebrating by trying out a new recipe! Enjoy your hard\n                        work!

                        There are many different ways you can distress furniture! I would like to share with you
                        one of my favored ways. It is simple and adds an authentic distressed look to your
                        furniture! Distressing in the decorative language is the pursuit of making a piece of
                        furniture or object look aged or older. The antique aged look has made a come back in
                        our world today, it has become very popular for that farmhouse look.The most familiar
                        way of distressing furniture is with sandpaper. Ive even seen some use a jagged rock as
                        well. The problem with these approaches are it is hard to control how deep these items
                        will sand down. If you sand off too much of the chalk paint you will start to see the color
                        underneath the new paint, or the wood underneath. With that being said i like to use
                        steel wool. It works great because it is more flexible than sandpaper making it fit on
                        those odd shaped surfaces.Below is a simple steps to distress your furniture.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Painting distressed furniture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Prepare your space.</p>
                            <p>
                                Lay down some plastic painters paper with the desired furniture on top. If you are
                                painting a dresser remove drawers and knobs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Clean desired furniture</p>
                            <p>
                                Take a clorox wipe or a simple rag with cleaning product and wipe down surface
                                removing loose depree. You can choose to sand down the furniture, however if your
                                using chalk paint which i reccomend, you can skip this step.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Paint the furniture</p>
                            <p>
                                If you are like me, this step is one of my favories! I always like to apply thin coats and
                                add coats if necessary. This prevents having that caked on look or having drip spots
                                shown in paint.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step Four:</strong> Let it dry</p>
                            <p>
                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break! Let furniture dry, do not rush this step!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>
                                Lightly dip your steel wool into a clear finishing wax. Try and get the spots where your
                                furniture would naturally show wear and tare. On dressers the corners are a great spot
                                and for kitchen chairs the edges and tops of chairs are a good plalce. Keep in mind the
                                raised details in furniture generally get more worn over time. After you pick the areas on
                                furniture to distress take your steel wool and lightly rub the area till you see paint is
                                being removed. Continue distressing until object looks as desired. Note, using clear
                                
                                finishing wax is only recommended not required. You can rub the steel wool dry and get
                                that distressed look.The wax helps the distressed area look lighter.
