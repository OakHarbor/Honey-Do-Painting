      "articleBody" : "There are many different ways you can distress furniture! I would like to share with you\n                        one of my favored ways. It is simple and adds an authentic distressed look to your\n                        furniture! Distressing in the decorative language is the pursuit of making a piece of\n                        furniture or object look aged or older. The antique aged look has made a come back in\n                        our world today, it has become very popular for that farmhouse look.The most familiar\n                        way of distressing furniture is with sandpaper. Ive even seen some use a jagged rock as\n                        well. The problem with these approaches are it is hard to control how deep these items\n                        will sand down. If you sand off too much of the chalk paint you will start to see the color\n                        underneath the new paint, or the wood underneath. With that being said i like to use\n                        steel wool. It works great because it is more flexible than sandpaper making it fit on\n                        those odd shaped surfaces.Below is a simple steps to distress your furniture.\n                    </P>\n                    <H3 class=\"blog-h3\">Painting distressed furniture</H3>\n                    <UL>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step One:</STRONG> Prepare your space.</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Lay down some plastic painters paper with the desired furniture on top. If you are\n                                painting a dresser remove drawers and knobs.</P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Two:</STRONG> Clean desired furniture</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Take a clorox wipe or a simple rag with cleaning product and wipe down surface\n                                removing loose depree. You can choose to sand down the furniture, however if your\n                                using chalk paint which i reccomend, you can skip this step.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Three:</STRONG> Paint the furniture</P>\n                            <P>\n                                If you are like me, this step is one of my favories! I always like to apply thin coats and\n                                add coats if necessary. This prevents having that caked on look or having drip spots\n                                shown in paint.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Four:</STRONG> Let it dry</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break! Let furniture dry, do not rush this step!\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Five:</STRONG> Distress furniture</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Lightly dip your steel wool into a clear finishing wax. Try and get the spots where your\n                                furniture would naturally show wear and tare. On dressers the corners are a great spot\n                                and for kitchen chairs the edges and tops of chairs are a good plalce. Keep in mind the\n                                raised details in furniture generally get more worn over time. After you pick the areas on\n                                furniture to distress take your steel wool and lightly rub the area till you see paint is\n                                being removed. Continue distressing until object looks as desired. Note, using clear\n                                \n                                finishing wax is only recommended not required. You can rub the steel wool dry and get\n                                that distressed look.The wax helps the distressed area look lighter.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Give yourself a pat on your back!!</STRONG> We hope your newly painted furniture adds that\n                            farmhouse style to your home! Distressing furniture is so much fun! Antique furniture\n                            can be pricey, therefore i love going to a goodwil shop picking out a piece of furniture\n                            and bringing it back to life!

                        Are you hoping to give your backyard an upgrade? Weather can take a major toll on
                        your deck, especially the sun beaming down on it. This project you will need to take
                        into consideration the weather outside, verify there will be no rain in the next week or
                        so. We highly recommend not skipping any steps and using the higher price product,
                        after all you get what you pay for and high quality will last a lot longer than the
                        discount product (in most cases of course). This project is lengthy and a bit laborious
                        so be prepared! It is well worth it, your backyard or front deck will look beautiful and
                        be much more pleasant. Remember to take safety measures by wearing safety goggles,
                        gloves and closed toe shoes!!

                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Common mistakes that can happen when staining a deck</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before we begin here are some <strong> mistakes to avoid:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too lazy to clean or invest in using a pressure washer</li>
                        <li>Staining too much, extra coats eventually flake and peel</li>
                        <li>Doing this in one day- this can take up to a week depending on weather</li>
                        <li>Starting mid day, you will want to start in the early morning and stop at noon or
                        your paint will dry too quickly and not absorb properly into wood</li>
                        <li>Using the cheapest brand, again you get what you pay for!</li>
                        <li>Working to fast, take your time doing steps right so you do not have to go back
                        and fix your mistakes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Steps on staining a deck</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Preparation</p>
                            <p>
                                This step is extremely important. If you do not properly prep, it will not take the stain!
                                You will want to sweep the area and possibly use a shop vac if available to
                                sweep/vacuum up any loose dust and debris. Next you will pressure wash the area. If
                                you do not have a pressure washer available to you, see about renting one, this will
                                guarantee a good clean. Let dry.</p>

                            <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Strip Deck</p>
                            <p>
                                This step is if you don't want to take time sanding the whole deck. You will need to
                                sand some areas but this helps strip the overall deck in one motion. We recommend
                                using Behr Premium wood stain & finish stripper. Follow the instructions completely.
                                Using a paint roller for this step will help speed up the process, let sit for 45 minutes.
                                Then you will scrub the area with a deck brush. Next use your hose or pressure washer
                                
                                to spray off the stiper. Be careful when using the pressure washer not to get too close
                                to the deck when spraying, it will chip your deck.

                            <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Wood Cleaner</p>
                            <p>
                                Wait a few hours after stripping the deck to apply the all in one wood cleaner. After
                                you have applied the wood cleaner, rinse the area. This will take all the remaining
                                stripper off the deck so the stain will stick better. Then you will want to rinse again
                                until the foam is completely gone. Let dry for 24 hours.

                            <p>
                                YES!! The last step is the most fun!! Behr premium semi transparent waterproof all in
                                one wood stain and sealer is a great long lasting product! It is one hundred percent
                                acrylic formula which seals out the elements and harmful sun uv rays for up to 6
                                years!! It also saves the step in sealing, because sealer is included! Follow directions
                                on product, apply stain to deck with a
                                roller brush to make this step more speedy. You can hit the harder to reach or smaller
                                areas with a paint brush. Let dry.
