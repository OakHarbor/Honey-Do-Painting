If you do not properly prep, it will not take the stain!\n                                You will want to sweep the area and possibly use a shop vac if available to\n                                sweep/vacuum up any loose dust and debris. Next you will pressure wash the area. If\n                                you do not have a pressure washer available to you, see about renting one, this will\n                                guarantee a good clean. Let dry.</P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Two:</STRONG> Strip Deck</P>\n                            <P>\n                                This step is if you don&#39;t want to take time sanding the whole deck. You will need to\n                                sand some areas but this helps strip the overall deck in one motion. We recommend\n                                using Behr Premium wood stain &amp; finish stripper. Follow the instructions completely.\n                                Using a paint roller for this step will help speed up the process, let sit for 45 minutes.\n                                Then you will scrub the area with a deck brush. Next use your hose or pressure washer\n                                \n                                to spray off the stiper. Be careful when using the pressure washer not to get too close\n                                to the deck when spraying, it will chip your deck.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Three:</STRONG> Wood Cleaner</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Wait a few hours after stripping the deck to apply the all in one wood cleaner. After\n                                you have applied the wood cleaner, rinse the area. This will take all the remaining\n                                stripper off the deck so the stain will stick better. Then you will want to rinse again\n                                until the foam is completely gone. Let dry for 24 hours.\n                            </P>\n                        </LI>\n                        <LI>\n                            <P><STRONG>Step Four:</STRONG> Let it dry</P>\n                            <P>\n                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break!

The last step is the most fun!! Behr premium semi transparent waterproof all in\n                                one wood stain and sealer is a great long lasting product! It is one hundred percent\n                                acrylic formula which seals out the elements and harmful sun uv rays for up to 6\n                                years!! It also saves the step in sealing, because sealer is included! Follow directions\n                                on product, apply stain to deck with a\n                                roller brush to make this step more speedy. You can hit the harder to reach or smaller\n                                areas with a paint brush. Let dry.\n                            </P>   \n                        </LI>\n                    </UL>\n                    <P>\n                        <EM>Now time to enjoy your hard work!!</EM> We hope your project turned out as desired and you\n                        can enjoy your deck for many years to come!

                    <p>
                        Before we begin here are some <strong> mistakes to avoid:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too lazy to clean or invest in using a pressure washer</li>
                        <li>Staining too much, extra coats eventually flake and peel</li>
                        <li>Doing this in one day- this can take up to a week depending on weather</li>
                        <li>Starting mid day, you will want to start in the early morning and stop at noon or
                        your paint will dry too quickly and not absorb properly into wood</li>
                        <li>Using the cheapest brand, again you get what you pay for!</li>
                        <li>Working to fast, take your time doing steps right so you do not have to go back
                        and fix your mistakes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3">Steps on staining a deck</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Preparation</p>
                            <p>
                                This step is extremely important. If you do not properly prep, it will not take the stain!
                                You will want to sweep the area and possibly use a shop vac if available to
                                sweep/vacuum up any loose dust and debris. Next you will pressure wash the area. If
                                you do not have a pressure washer available to you, see about renting one, this will
                                guarantee a good clean. Let dry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Strip Deck</p>
                            <p>
                                This step is if you don't want to take time sanding the whole deck. You will need to
                                sand some areas but this helps strip the overall deck in one motion. We recommend
                                using Behr Premium wood stain & finish stripper. Follow the instructions completely.
                                Using a paint roller for this step will help speed up the process, let sit for 45 minutes.
                                Then you will scrub the area with a deck brush. Next use your hose or pressure washer
                                
                                to spray off the stiper. Be careful when using the pressure washer not to get too close
                                to the deck when spraying, it will chip your deck.

                            <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Wood Cleaner</p>
                            <p>
                                Wait a few hours after stripping the deck to apply the all in one wood cleaner. After
                                you have applied the wood cleaner, rinse the area. This will take all the remaining
                                stripper off the deck so the stain will stick better. Then you will want to rinse again
                                until the foam is completely gone. Let dry for 24 hours.

                            <p><strong>Step Four:</strong> Let it dry</p>
                            <p>
                                Grab a cup of coffee and take a deserved break! Let furniture dry, do not rush this step!

                            <p><strong>Step Five:</strong> Stain the deck!</p>
                            <p>
                                YES!! The last step is the most fun!! Behr premium semi transparent waterproof all in
                                one wood stain and sealer is a great long lasting product! It is one hundred percent
                                acrylic formula which seals out the elements and harmful sun uv rays for up to 6
                                years!! It also saves the step in sealing, because sealer is included! Follow directions
                                on product, apply stain to deck with a
                                roller brush to make this step more speedy. You can hit the harder to reach or smaller
                                areas with a paint brush. Let dry.
